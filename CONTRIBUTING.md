# Adding a robot to the list

Robots in this list are all open source, **both HW and SW**. Here is our attempt at defining that:

### üõ†Ô∏è Open build

Instructions and build files, such as 3D printing models, should be published under a permissive or copyleft license.

* **Discussions:** since instructions are never 100% complete, it is also better if there is some way of communicating with project maintainers to fill out the blanks (*e.g.* GitHub discussions).
* **Tools:** ideally build tools and parts can all be sourced by makers on consumer markets, such as DIY stores or online retail. For example, 3D printing in ABS or PETG works, but in tungsten carbide is not OK for all; relying on a low-cost MEMS IMU works for most, but a space-grade IMU won't be OK for all.

### ü¶æ Open motion control

All the software necessary to make the robot move should be available under a permissive or copyleft software license.
