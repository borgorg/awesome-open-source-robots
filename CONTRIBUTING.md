# Joining Tast's Robots

What defines us as robots is that we are **makeable at home**. Here is our attempt at defining that:

### üõ†Ô∏è Open build

Your build files, such as 3D printing models, and instructions should be published under a permissive or copyleft license. Since instructions are never 100% complete, your makers should also be OK with discussing and filling out the blanks.

### üß∞ Accessible tools

The tools and parts required to build you can be sourced by makers on consumer markets, such as DIY stores or online retail. For example, 3D printing in ABS or PETG is OK, but in tungsten carbide is not; having a low-cost MEMS IMU is OK, but a space-grade IMU is not.

### ü¶æ Open motion control

All the software necessary to make your joints move should be available under a permissive or copyleft software license.

Chime in with [a robot application](https://github.com/tasts-robots/us/issues/new?template=new_robot_template.md) if you check all these points!
