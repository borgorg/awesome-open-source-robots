# Joining Tast's Robots

Robots in this list are all **makeable at home**. Here is our attempt at defining that:

### üõ†Ô∏è Open build

Your instructions and build files, such as 3D printing models, should be published under a permissive or copyleft license. Since instructions are never 100% complete, you should also provide a way to discuss the project and fill out the blanks (*e.g.* GitHub discussions).

### üß∞ Accessible tools

The tools and parts required to build can be sourced by makers on consumer markets, such as DIY stores or online retail. For example, 3D printing in ABS or PETG is OK, but in tungsten carbide is not; having a low-cost MEMS IMU is OK, but a space-grade IMU is not.

### ü¶æ Open motion control

All the software necessary to make the robot move should be available under a permissive or copyleft software license.
