# Joining Tast's Robots

To join our gang as a robot, you must be hardware and software reproducible in the following sense:

### Open build

Your build files, such as 3D printing models, and instructions should be published under a permissive (CC-BY-4.0, Apache-2.0, …) or copyleft (CC-BY-SA-4.0, GPL-3.0, …) license. Since instructions are never 100% complete, your makers should also be OK with discussing and filling out the blanks.

### Accessible parts

The tools and parts required to build you can be sourced by makers on consumer markets (DIY stores, ordering online, …). For example, 3D printing in ABS or PETG is OK, but in tungsten carbide is not; having a low-cost MEMS IMU is OK, but a space-grade IMU is not.

### Motion control included

The software necessary to make each of your joints move should be available under a permissive or copyleft software license.
